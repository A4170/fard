<h1>Step 3: build the inner grid</h1>

<p1>
The inner grid (where the high voltage is applied) must now be built and attached to a high voltage feedthrough.
</p1>
<style> p1 {font-size:25px;} 
p1 {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>

  It is best to use a metal such as tungsten for the grid wires since it has a very high melting point, and the grid will get extremely hot during high power runs.
</p2>
<style> p2 {font-size:25px;}
p2 {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
<p3>
  This can be built however you wish, as long as it resembles a spherical shape of roughly 1-1.5 inches in diameter (for a 6-8" chamber), it should work fine.
</p3>
<style> p3 {font-size:25px;} 
p3 {
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
<p4>
  The grid should be internally attached to an electrical feedthrough such as the one pictured in the second image. This feedthrough needs to be rated for the cathode voltage that will be used, typically 40kv is a good target voltage.
