Step 2: Prepare high vacuum pump 
</h1>
<ui>
  <p1>
  Install the oil diffusion pump (or turbo pump if you have a bit of luck scrounging or a higher budget). Fill the pump with quality diffusion pump oil to whatever fill level the pump documentation suggests. attach the inlet to a valve which then connects to the chamber (see diagram) and attach the outlet to a mechanical backing pump capable of reaching at least around 75 microns (any higher and the diffusion pump will not operate properly or the oil will oxidize quickly).

  Make sure the pump is sufficiently cooled, many oil diffusion pumps require water cooling, smaller ones can get by with a decent air flow.

  Once this is assembled, turn on the mechanical pump and wait for the vacuum to reach at least 75 microns. Next you can test the high vacuum pump by turning on the boiler on the diffusion pump. After it warms up (could take a while), the vacuum should rapidly drop below the single micron range.
