Requirements
</h1>
<ui>
<li>A vaccuum chamber, preferably in a spherical shape</li>
<li>A roughing vaccuum pump capable of reaching at least 75 microns vacuum</li>
<li>A secondary high vaccuum pump pump, either a turbo pump or oil diffusion pump</li>
<li>A high voltage supply, preferably capable of at least 40kv 10ms - Must be negative polarity</li>
<li>A high voltage divider probe for use with a digital multimeter</li>
<li>a thermocouple or baratron (of appropriate scale) vaccuum gauge</li>
<li>a neutron radiation detector, either a proportional He-3 or BF3 tube with counting instrumentation, or a bubble dosimeter</li>
<li>A geiger counter, preferably a scintillator type, for a x-ray detection and safety</li>
<li>Deuterium gas (you can buy this as a gas or extract it from D20 through electrolysis - its much easier and more effective to use compressed gas</li>
<li>A large ballast resistor in the range of 50-100k and at least a foot long</li>
<li>A camera and TV display for viewing the inside of the reactor</li>
<li>lead to shield the camera viewport</li>
<li>general engineering tools, a machine shop if all possible (although 20% of mine was built with nothing but a dremel and cordless drill, the only thing you really can't build without a shop is scratch building the vaccuum chamber)</li>
